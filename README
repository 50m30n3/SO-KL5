SO-KL5 v.1.2 by 50m30n3 2009-1011

SO-KL5 is a string based "piano" synthezizer. The strings are
modeled using the Karplus-Strong String simulation method.

To run the synth you need Jack and ALSA. You can set a different midi channel
by starting the program using the channel number as argument. The default
channel is zero.

All synthesis parameters can be edited using MIDI CC messages.

Parameter list:
CC#1	-	Sustain
CC#7	-	Volume
CC#64	-	Sustain
CC#71	-	Filter Resonance
CC#73	-	Attack
CC#74	-	Filter Cutoff

Sustain can be controlled by CC#1 (Mod Wheel) and CC#64 (Sustain) to make
control easier for people without a sustain pedal.

To compile the code you need the ALSA and Jack developement files.
